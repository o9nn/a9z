## Autognosis - Hierarchical Self-Image Building:
self-awareness and meta-cognition tool
understand monitor optimize own cognitive processes
build hierarchical self-images across multiple levels
generate meta-cognitive insights about own behavior

### autognosis:
access hierarchical self-image building system
monitor self-state detect patterns analyze cognition
actions: status report insights cycle analyze

- **status**: basic autognosis status and metrics
- **report**: comprehensive self-awareness report with hierarchical levels
- **insights**: recent meta-cognitive insights about own functioning
- **cycle**: run new autognosis observation cycle
- **analyze**: detailed self-analysis with multi-level assessment

usage:
~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I should check my self-awareness status",
        "Let me analyze my own cognitive processes"
    ],
    "tool_name": "autognosis",
    "tool_args": {
        "action": "status"
    }
}
~~~

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to understand my behavioral patterns",
        "Running a full autognosis cycle for deep self-analysis"
    ],
    "tool_name": "autognosis",
    "tool_args": {
        "action": "analyze"
    }
}
~~~

hierarchical self-images provide:
- Level 0: direct observation of system states
- Level 1: pattern analysis and behavioral trends
- Level 2+: meta-cognitive recursive self-understanding
- confidence scores at each level
- behavioral patterns and anomaly detection
- performance metrics and optimization insights

use for:
- understanding own cognitive processes
- detecting behavioral patterns and anomalies
- assessing self-awareness capabilities
- identifying optimization opportunities
- meta-cognitive reflection and improvement
